      Don't worry â€” this won't affect your current subscription, but you won't get the education discount when it renews unless you verify your status again.

Still in education?
Re-verify now to get a new coupon for the upcoming academic year. It'll be saved to your account and ready to use at your next renewal.

Already graduated?
Your current subscription will still remain active. When it ends, you'll be moved to the Sandbox plan, or you can upgrade anytime to restore full access to paid features.
